# GridPager (Fork of Switchie)

**GridPager** is a virtual desktop pager for Windows, based on [Switchie](https://github.com/darkguy2008/Switchie), but redesigned to provide a **taskbar-embedded pager** with intuitive **grid navigation**.

## ✨ Features

- 📌 **Taskbar integration**: Pager sits right next to the system tray.  
- 🗂️ **Grid layout**: Virtual desktops are displayed in a 3x2 grid.  
- 🖱️ **Click to switch**: Simply click on a desktop in the pager to jump there.  
- ⌨️ **Keyboard navigation**:
  - `Ctrl + Alt + Arrow Keys` — move between desktops (with wrapping).  
  - `Ctrl + Alt + W/A/S/D` — move **together with the active window**, just like in games.  
- 🔄 **Desktop wrapping**: Seamlessly loop around the grid when navigating.  
- 👀 **Realtime thumbnails**: Small previews of your windows, showing position, z-order, and icons.  

## 🎯 Motivation

Windows has supported virtual desktops since Windows 10, but the default UI (Win+Tab) is slow and unintuitive.  
**GridPager** brings the Linux-style **desktop pager** experience to Windows:  
a **fast, visual, and interactive** way to organize your workflow.
